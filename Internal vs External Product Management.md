Internal Product Management refers to applying product management principles and techniques to develop and manage products or tools intended for internal use. These internal products are not designed for the consumer but are used to improve and streamline internal processes, procedures, and efficiency within the organization. Example: HRIS, CRM, ERP, and other internal tools. 
External product management, on the other hand, includes developing products and services intended for external customers. They could be tangible products from cosmetics to electronics, or digital products, ranging from payment gateways to cloud services
